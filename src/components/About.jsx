                My expertise in programming languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails has been substantiated by a history of notable achievements. I have consistently demonstrated my ability to deliver exceptional results and have a proven track record to support this claim.

                I have embraced the challenges and opportunities of remote work by actively engaging with individuals spanning multiple time zones. Over the past several months, I have adeptly navigated the complexities of asynchronous collaboration, seamlessly interacting with team members located in three distinct time zones: UTC-6, UTC+1, and UTC+5. This unique experience sets me apart and underscores my adaptability as a fullstack developer.
